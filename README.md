<h1>Sentiment Analysis of Airline Tweets Using LSTM</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on a big data set of airline tweets using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The dataset contains thousands of tweets labeled with sentiments such as positive, neutral, and negative. The data was preprocessed by removing unnecessary text elements like mentions and URLs, followed by tokenization and padding to prepare the inputs for the LSTM model. The LSTM model, built using TensorFlow and Keras, was trained to classify tweets based on sentiment, utilizing word embeddings for effective text representation. During the evaluation phase, the model's performance was assessed using a confusion matrix, classification report, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. The results indicated that the model was able to identify negative sentiments with reasonable accuracy but struggled with classifying positive and neutral sentiments, as reflected in the precision and recall scores. Despite the challenges in balancing classes, this project demonstrates the potential of using deep learning models like LSTM for analyzing large-scale text data and extracting insights into customer sentiment.
